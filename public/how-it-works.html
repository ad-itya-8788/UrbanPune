    <h1>How It Works – Pune Rooms</h1>

    <p>At Pune Rooms, we make finding a place to stay easy, fast, and secure. Here's how our platform works:</p>

    <h2>1. Browse Accommodation Listings</h2>
    <p>Start by browsing through a variety of property listings including rooms, flats, PGs, and hostels across Pune.
      Filter the listings based on your preferences such as price, location, and type of accommodation.</p>

    <h2>2. Post Your Property</h2>
    <p>If you are a property owner or host, you can easily create a listing. Simply fill out the details like location,
      rent, and images, and share your contact information to make it easy for potential tenants to reach you.</p>

    <h2>3. Contact Property Owners</h2>
    <p>If you are interested in a listing, reach out to the property owner directly through the platform. We provide
      communication tools that allow users to contact each other privately and securely.</p>

    <h2>4. Visit the Property</h2>
    <p>Before making any decisions, always visit the property to verify the details. We recommend only meeting with the
      owner in person and viewing the accommodation before any transaction.</p>

    <h2>5. Secure Your Stay</h2>
    <p>Once you are happy with a property, you can proceed with the booking or renting process directly with the
      property owner. We advise never making payments before confirming the accommodation in person.</p>

    <h2>6. Leave a Review</h2>
    <p>Once your stay is complete, you can leave a review to help future users make informed decisions about their
      accommodation. Reviews help build trust and transparency in our community.</p>
